I'm Sean and this is my blog.  I currently run a small, private Minecraft server (a [civcraft][civcraft_url] clone) located at mc.mirango.io and a mumble server located at m.mirango.io.

Mirango.io content is served using nginx (on a headless Ubuntu 14.04 server).  All users connect using HTTPS (301 redirects for all traffic connecting to port 80) and the server supports SPDY - the code is available [here][github_nginx].  The majority of content on mirango.io is static and created using Jekyll - code is available [here][github_mirango].
