I've decided it's time I should start another blog.  I've had several blogs in the past, mostly self hosted wordpress blogs.  Last year I discovered something that caught my eye.  Static site generators.  Since my blog will be serving identical pages to everybody, there's really no need for a complicated (and often buggy) backend.  Rather than storing posts and pages on a database, a static site generator generates static HTML from a mix of templates, markdown, and css (less/scss too).  For mirango.io I decided to use Jekyll, one of the most popular static site generators.

Take the time and look at the source for Mirango.io.  It's available on [GitHub][mirango] along with the Nginx [configuration file][nginx].
